Champaner is an ancient fort located at the foothills of Pavagadh. The town derives its name from the Champa tree or from Champaraj founder of the town, a contemporary of King Vanraj Chavda of Anhilwada.

<br>
<br>
Muhammad Begada decided to establish the new capital of Gujarat at this place in 1484 AD and changed the name of the town to Muhammadabad. It took 23 years to built the town and had a meteoric rise and attained glory as a great town of western India. Many edifices were constructed during these years : bazaars,town squares, Royal Gardens and water structures, including mosques. It also became a major trading center producing fine silk, woven and dyed textile and sword manufacturing
<br><br>
Its decline started after attacks by the Mughal Emperor Humayun in 1535 AD. After the death of Sultan Bahadurshah (1536 AD), the Royal Capital was again moved back to Ahmedabad. Later, the fort came under control of Mughals, Marathas and British; but Champaner could never regain its glory. In 1803 AD, when the British took the town, it was overgrown with jungles and had only 500 inhabitants.

<b>Day 09: BHUJ – MANDVI</b><br>				
  Post breakfast drive to Mandvi.
  <br>
  Mandvi was founded as a port town by the Khengarji, the king of Kutch, in 1574. The first temple to be built was the Sundarwar temple, followed by the Jama Masjid in 1603, the Lakshminarayan Temple in 1607, the Kajivali Mosque in 1608 and the Rameshwar Temple in 1627. For all of this to have been built in the first 50 years of the towns existence is a clear indicator of its importance to the kingdom. Indeed, at its peak, Mandvi's wealth easily surpassed that of the capital at Bhuj, and it was only after ships grew too large for its harbor and began to prefer Mumbai that Mandvi started fading from the scene. 
<br>
<br>
For 400 years, the shipbuilding industry has been the center of life in Mandvi. It was once the principal port of Kutch and of Gujarat. At its peak, exports were said to outnumber imports fourfold, and their revenue reflected that. Ships came and went from East Africa, the Persian Gulf, the Malabar Coast (now called Kerala, in south India), and South-East Asia. During Rao Godiji's reign in the 1760's, he built and maintained a fleet of 400 ships, one that sailed as far as England and returned. The city used to have 8 m. fortified walls around it, but only small portions remain.
<br><br>
In 1929 the Vijay Vilas palace was built by Rao Vijayrajji, and is maintained in excellent condition today. The British Political Agent based in Bhuj had summer quarters at Mandvi, and the British cemetery attests to the extended presence of the British in the area.

<br>
<b>Day 10: IN MANDVI </b><br>
Full day explore the town.
<br><br>
A visit to the beach, exploring the shipbuilding area, a walk along the river; all these are indispensable. But the town is also easily explored on foot, and it is well worth wandering the narrow streets to check out the mix of old architecture. Many wealthy barons during the city's heyday had flamboyant houses built, with lots of European influence; it is not uncommon to see carved angels, or stained-glass windows. The many bazaars, where all kinds of goods can be found, from bandhani textiles to tasty fresh produce, should not be missed. Specific points of interest are as follows:
