Arrive Delhi. You will be met by our representative at the arrivals lounge and escorted till your check in at Hotel.<br>

Delhi, the Empress of Indian cities has a fascinating history and a stimulating present. She has often been sacked and left naked and desolate. But she could not be despoiled of the incomparable situation that marks her for the metropolis of a Great Empire. The capital of India, Delhi has been the seat of power of a number of dynasties – the Rajputs, the Afghans, the Turks and the Mughals who continued their imperial line until the British. Scattered over are surviving ruins, remnants of mighty edifices, tombs of warriors and saints, which in an impressive sense of magnificence are memorials not of a single city but of supplanted nations.<br>
Overnight at Hotel.<br>

<b>Day 03:				Delhi – Corbett  </b><br>
Post breakfast drive to Corbett.<br>
<br>
Corbett is India’s first national park and one of its finest.  It is notable not only for its rich and varied wildlife and bird life but also for its scenic charm and magnificent sub-montane and riverain views.  Set up in 1936, in large part due to the efforts of Jim Corbett, this wildlife reserve was name Hailey National Park after the Governor of United Provinces. On Independence it was renamed the Ramganga National Park and later still the Corbett National Park.  <br>
<br>
The park comprises the broad valley of the Ramganga River backing onto the forest-covered slopes of the Himalayan foot hills which rise to 1210 m. at Kanda Peak. Longitudinal ridges separate ravines and uplands.  Adam at Kalagarh has created a large reservoir at the western end of the park.  The Ramganga itself runs through high and narrow banks in places.  The only perennial source of water, it meanders to the northwest, creating a beautiful scene from Dhikala.<br>

<b>Day 04:				In Corbett  </b><br>
Morning & Afternoon game ride in the park with the naturalist.<br>
<br>
The park has always been noted for its tigers, there are around 50 but are not easily spotted.  About 10% of visitors see one – usually entering at the Bijrani gate.  There are leopards too but they are seldom seen.  Sambar, Chital, para and (hog deer) and muntjac (barking deer) are the main prey of the big cats and their population fluctuates around 20,000.  Some like the chital are highly gregarious whilst the large sambar, visually very impressive with its antlers, is usually solitary.  The two commonly seen monkeys of North India are the rhesus (a macaque – reddish face and brownish body) and the common langur (black face and silvery coat). Elephants are now permanent inhabitants since the Ramganga Dam has flooded their old trekking routes.  There are now a few hundred and they are seen quite often. Other animals include porcupine, wild pigs (often seen around Dhikala), one male is quite dangerous and attacks unsuspecting visitors who have food with them).  In total there are over 50 species of mammal alone, though the dam appears to have caused significant losses.  The last Swamp deer was seen in Mar 1978, and the loss of habitat has been keenly felt by the cheetal, hog deer and porcupine, all of which appear to be declining.<br>

Some individual tigers in the reserve that developed unique styles of hunting became the subjects of films and books that have won worldwide acclaim. The 10th century fort that overlooks the reserve provides a sense of grandeur and history that puts its diversity of wildlife (much of which continue to use the ancient ramparts!) in unique perspective.<br>

<br>
35 kms after Agra is Fatehpur Sikri, the abandoned red sandstone city built in the 16th century by the Mughal Emperor Akbar, one of India's greatest rulers. Remarkably broadminded for his time, this Muslim king married a Rajput princess in order to win over his Hindu subjects. The architecture at Fatehpur Sikri is a combination of Hindu and Muslim styles, expressing Akbar's vision of synthesizing the cultures.<br>
<br>
<strong>Continue to Agra.</strong><br>
Agra, the city known for the famous monument of love - the Taj Mahal. The Mughal Emperor, Shah Jehan, constructed Taj Mahal. It is said he built this monument in the memory of his beloved wife Mumtaj Mahal. The Taj Mahal is ethereal at any part of the day - blushing in the rosy glow of dawn or sunset, appearing like a pearly mirage in the moonlight or reflected in the pools of the garden. Perhaps the most moving view of the Taj is from an octagonal tower in the Agra Fort further along the river Yamuna. <br>
<br>
There are very few cities in the world that can match the history and heritage of Agra. Located at a distance of 204 km south of Delhi, Agra is the single most famous tourist destination of India. Situated on the west bank of River Yamuna, Agra is a part of the great Norther Indian plains. The architectural splendor of the city is reflected in the glorious monuments of medieval India built by great Mughals who ruled India for more than 300 years. <br>
<br>
In the mid 16th century and earlier 17th century Agra witnessed a frenzied building activity and it was during this time when the symbol of love Taj Mahal was built. The buildings made during this era were purely in the contemporary Mughal style and of very high quality, which is still reflected in whatever monuments remain in Agra. <br>
<br>
On arrival transfer check in at hotel.<br>
Afternoon visit Taj Mahal (Closed on Friday) & Agra Fort.<br>
<br>
With its incredible lacy white grandeur the Taj Mahal is perhaps the most perfect architectural monument in the world. To the poet Tagore it was a `tear on the face of eternity'.  In memory of his wife the great Mughal emperor Shah Jehan constructed this most extravagant and incomparable monument built for love. Amazingly graceful from any angle, it is the close up detail, which is really astounding.   <br>
<br>
Agra Fort is situated on the banks for the river Yamuna, another monumental mission accomplished by the great Mughal visionary Emperor Akbar. His son Jehangir and grandson Shah Jehan added to this imposing structure during their rule. The Palaces, mosques and audience halls contained within its massive wall of red sandstone are perfect examples of blending Islamic and Hindu traditions. <br>

The same abundance of wildlife and variety of species still exists today and the park which forms the core of the Kanha Tiger Reserve (1,945 sq. km) within the game reserve, created in 1974, also protects the rare hard-ground-adapted barasingha (swamp deer). The park has deciduous hardwoods including sal and stands of bamboo, rolling grasslands and meandering stream of the Banjar River.  It lies in the Mandla District in the Makai Hills in the eastern part of the Satpura Range. Originally the area was famed as a hunter’s paradise but now the valley has been well developed as a national park<br>

<br>
Kolkata over the years has been ‘The City of Paradoxes’. Living up to this name, Kolkata had done away with the so-far-accepted story of its birth. After a legal battle, the courts have ruled that Job Charnock was not the founder the city, and that August day in 1690, the 24th, when he landed on the banks of the Hooghly River, is not the birthday of Kolkata. The courts have ruled that sufficients evidence is available to accept that Kolkata existed before Job Charnock’s arrival. So after quite a long period of accepting 24 August 1690 as Kolkata’s Birthday and Job Charnock as the city’s Founding Father, the city is currently ‘fatherless’ and without a birthday. Past history may have got shrouded in doubts, but there is no doubt at all about the current –history –in –the –marking. The city is fast expanding eastwards with landmarks –type residential building and institutional /commercial complexes of the most impressive, contemporary stylish kind coming up at many places on and around the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and the road to the airport. A city center is coming up in the Salt Lake area, Satellite Township has been planned at Rajarhat; and much more that is beautiful and impressive is being created. All this coupled with a number of flyovers, widening of roads, continued explosion of quality retail shopping malls/high class stores, and many other such activities show that Kolkata is on the fast track of development and modernization.<br>
<br>
The almost – religious attachment and following of the city’s famous football clubs is making way for the greater popularity of cricket. If this be taken as an indication, Kolkata is firmly in the grip of the winds of change. The results of these changes can only be told by the future. Wherever it may reach, Kolkata remains a wonderful, humane and throbbing living megapolis.<br>
