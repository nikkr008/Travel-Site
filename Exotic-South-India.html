We support Responsible Tourism…
<br><br>
Responsible Tourism is about “making better places for people to live in and better places for people to visit.” Responsible Tourism requires that operators, hoteliers, governments, local people and tourists take responsibility, take action to make tourism more sustainable.
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: circle;">minimises negative economic, environmental and social impacts;</li>
<li style="list-style-type: circle;">generates greater economic benefits for local people and enhances the well-being of host communities, improves working conditions and access to the industry;</li>
<li style="list-style-type: circle;">involves local people in decisions that affect their lives and life changes;</li>
<li style="list-style-type: circle;">makes positive contributions to the conservation of natural and cultural heritage, to the maintenance of the world’s diversity;</li>

<br><br>
Doorways to Nature, Community & Ecology
<br><br>
At CGH Earth, nature and the environment take centre stage. Every experience is inspired by and built around this core, be it the forests at Spice Village or the fishing villages of Marari Beach. The structures become part of the landscape, using natural as well as modern materials to blend in. Modern day life fades into the background, allowing one to experience nature in its most pristine form. Every CGH hotel is its own unique experience, allowing nature herself to replenish its guests.
<br><br>
Experiences of Community                      
<div class="feature-img">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Exotic-south-india/exotic south2.jpg" alt="">
 </div>
<br>
The chain borrowed the recipes of the local communities using locally grown ingredients and refined them, helping the guests experience the joys of tasty, wholesome food that is unique to the region. In return, the resorts have endeavored to employ people from the local community, be it the naturalist who guides through the wilderness or the therapist who rejuvenates the guest mind and body. The chain instituted community based programmes that helped rehabilitate poachers and smugglers. Local tribes were taught organic farming techniques, which helped them to prosper and preserve their way of life. 
<br><br>
Experiences of Heritage
<div class="feature-img">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Exotic-south-india/exotic south3.jpg" alt="">
 </div>
<br>
All CGH hotels have adopted the local culture and way of life. Paying homage to traditional modes of living.  The transplanted Kerala tharavads at Coconut Lagoon were restored by hand, in a process that took years, bringing to life Kerala's gracious mansions of old. At Brunton Boatyard one will experience the varied and rich histories of Fort Kochi in every aspect, from the interiors of the hotel to the cuisine. And Visalam is a celebration of the noble land of Chettinad. Heritage, CGH believes, is the ground beneath their feet, giving them roots in a changing world

Arrive Chettinad and check in to the hotel for overnight stay.
<br><br>
Visit the famous Chettinad Palace which is one of the most glorious examples of Chettinad's widely famed palatial mansions. You might come across others hugging the palace’s walls or so it would seem. While the palace can evoke such strong feelings, it's actually people feeling the smooth-as-a-fluffy-pillow plaster of the walls for which they are widely famed. Evidently, the Chettiyars would rub eggs and lime on them to get its smooth-as-butter finish. 
<br><br>
In the afternoon one could enjoy strolling through the local weekly markets followed by a village walk. Chettinad is village life pure. The absence of trucks, buses and heavy traffic turns this place into a slow and laid back village, where you can interact with locals, take a ride with a cycle or just simply stroll the little markets. Also visit the “Vaara Sabdhai”, the weekly market. The weekly markets are unspoiled and a great treat to visit. Vegetable- and fruit vendors display their wares under colorful canopies, bantering with customers and tourists alike. There is also a fish market and a section for household and farm utensils. The market is setup on a temporary base to be moved to the next place for the next day. After the market, stop for a traditional cup of tea before visiting some of the great mansions of the area.

<br>This tour offers an introduction to the many faiths and cultures of the Malabar Coast.
<br>Muziris is the name of an ancient port city on the Kerala coast, an hour’s drive north of Cochin. The city traded in spices, silk, and precious stones; with exports to Rome, Greece, Egypt, etc. Enriched by trade contacts, Muziris became a melting pot of world cultures. The earliest Jewish settlers in India landed on the Malabar Coast and flourished in Muziris. Muziris is where St. Thomas the Apostle is said to have first landed in 52AD, bringing Christianity to India. The first ever mosque in India was also built here. 
<br><br>
After nearly 1000 years of thriving trade, the port of Muziris was damaged in a major flood, and Cochin took its place as the most important trading port in Kerala. However, the Muziris area – covering Kodungallur and Paravoor – continues to be as multi-cultural as ever. Old churches, synagogues, mosques and temples attest to the great confluence of cultures that Muziris was. In a world full of strife, the monuments and bazaars of Muziris stand as beacons even today, a testament to the harmonious co-existence of multiple faiths on the Malabar Coast.
<br><br>
Tour Coverage: On this tour, we will visit the following:
•	Kodungalloor Bhagavathi Temple: A Hindu temple to Goddess Bhadrakali in existence since ancient times and rebuilt over the years. Steeped in powerful myths and legends, the temple attracts many locals and pilgrims for its daily worship, rituals and festivals.
•	Chennamangalam and Paravoor Synagogues: Old synagogues of the Malabar Jews, constructed using Keralan building traditions, but adapted to suit Jewish ritual and liturgical requirements. Near the Chennamangalam synagogue is also the first Christian Seminary and the first printing press in India.
•	Kottakavu Church: A church of the Syrian Christian community of Kerala, believed to be the one of the seven original ones established by the Apostle St. Thomas
•	Paliam Dutch Palace (Museum): The residence of the Paliath Achans, the prime ministers to the Rajas of the State of Kochi. 
•	Cheraman Juma Masjid: The first mosque in India, built after the Chera king of Kerala met the Prophet Muhammad. It has been renovated several times since then.
