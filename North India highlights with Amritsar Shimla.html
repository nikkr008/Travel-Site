<b>Day 01: Arrive Delhi </b><br>
Arrive at New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport by flight.
<br><br>
Delhi - the capital of India – The city consists of two parts - Old & New Delhi. Old
Delhi was the capital of Muslim India between 17th and 19th century and has many
mosques, monuments and forts. New Delhi, the imperial city was created by the British as
the capital of India. In 1911, Edwin Lutyens, the most renowned English architect of the
day, was chosen to design New Delhi which flaunts a surprising number of impressive
monuments related to its conquests by the Mughals, Turks, Persians and ultimately the
British.
<br><br>
Meet & Assist: you will be met by our representative in the arrival area of the airport
after you clear all immigration and customs formalities. You will be transferred to your
hotel.
<br><br>
Check-in at your hotel.

<br><br>
Overnight: Hotel
<br>
<br>
<b>Day 02: In Delhi </b><br>

Today you will tour some of the other sights of the capital city. Today you will explore
the area referred to as Old Delhi. This was the former Imperial capital of the Mughal
Emperor, though very little remains of the grandeur of the Emperor Shah Jahan’s city.
You will visit the Red Fort which was built in the mid-17th century when the Emperor
moved his capital from Agra to Delhi. From here you drive to the 300 year old Chandni
Chowk market, its narrow lanes best explored in a cycle rickshaw. As you wind your way
through the narrow alleys you will see remnants of the grand houses that were once the
homes of wealthy nobles. Today it is a busy market selling an extraordinary variety of
items – silver, jewelry, aromatic spices, leather, fruit and vegetables. Apothecaries
sell home grown medicinal items, and roadside dentists display their bizarre array of
equipment and false teeth. This is an excellent introduction to the organized chaos
which is quintessentially Indian. You will disembark at the Jama Masjid, believed to be
the largest mosque in India and which was Shah Jahan’s last architectural legacy.
Originally it was called Masjid-I-Jahanum which means “The mosque commanding a view of
the world”. In complete contrast to the noise and crowds of Old Delhi, Raj Ghat is an
oasis of manicured lawns and peace. This is the simple yet stunning memorial to Mahatma
Gandhi, the main architect of India’s independence.

<br><br>
Afternoon you tour some of the sights of the capital city. You will start at the Qutb
Minar complex which has many historic monuments. The first mosque in India – The
Quwwat-Ul- Islam – built from the dressed and carved stones of demolished temples lies
in this complex. It establishes the political victory of Islam in northern India. The
Qutb Minar was begun in 1199 by Qutb ud din Aibak and was completed by his successors.
This fluted elegant tower is decorated with elegant balconies and carvings. From here
you visit one of the architectural triumphs of the Mughal Empire – Humayun’s Tomb.
Humayun’s tomb is the earliest example of Mughal architecture in India. Recently
renovated with the gardens restored to their former splendor and the fountains working,
it is a very attractive site. Architecturally the mausoleum drew its inspiration from
the styles prevalent in Samarkand, and the design of the Taj Mahal is based on this
tomb.
<br><br>
You return to your hotel via the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Combining what Lord Hardinge, The
Viceroy suggested “western architecture with an Oriental motif”, this former viceregal
lodge, today is the home of the President of India. Though the incorporation of Indian
motifs in the final design was superficial, the enormous dome was fashioned on the great
Buddhist Stupa at Sanchi. You will drive up Rajpath, stopping at the India Gate. This
was designed by Lutyen in memory of the 70,000 Indian soldiers who died in the First
World War. Among the other buildings you will stop at will be the Parliament House; The
Cathedral Church of Redemption and to its north the Italianate Roman Catholic Church of
the Sacred Heart. Both these were conceived by Henry Medd whose design won architectural
competitions.
<br><br>
Overnight at Hotel.
<br><br>

<b>Day 03: Delhi - Agra </b><br>

Morning drive to Agra.
<br><br>
Agra: Two great Mughal monarchs, Akbar and Shah Jahan, transformed the little village of
Agra into a befitting second capital of the Mughal Empire - giving it the name
Dar-ul-Khilafat {seat of the Emperor}. Today, a visitor to Agra is caught up in a world
of contrasting edifices of red sandstone and white marble, narrow gullies and quaint
buggies, and that irresistible charm that this favorite city of the Mughal still
retains. It is not surprising, that modern Agra still reflects its Mughal heritage most
conspicuously.
<br><br>
Upon arrival, check in at Hotel.
<br><br>
Overnight at Hotel
<br><br>

<b>Day 04: In Agra </b><br>

Morning visit Taj Mahal & Agra fort.
<br><br>
Taj Mahal is perhaps the world’s most perfectly proportioned monument. This stunning
mausoleum immortalized the name of Shah Jahan’s last wife Mumtaz Mahal, “light of the
palace”. Built by Indian artisans and artisans from neighboring Islamic countries, it is
aptly described by the poet laureate Tagore as “A tear on the face of eternity”.
Decorated with a mosaic of semi-precious stones and Persian calligraphy recreating
verses from the Koran, the mausoleum is an “Urs”, an important place of pilgrimage since
the empress died in childbirth making her a martyr. Prayers are said and passages from
Koran are constantly recited in the mosque and cenotaph chamber.
<br><br>
After leisurely breakfast you visit Agra Fort. The present structure stands on the site
of 14th century fort that was occupied by the Lodi Sultans of Delhi. When the Mughal
Emperor Akbar established his supremacy in Northern India, he began his first
architectural venture, rebuilding the fort as a beautiful fort palace. The work was
completed by his son and grandson, highlighting the Mughal’s ability to blend defensive
and decorative architecture. Richly decorated with marble and mosaic, it was in a part
of this fort that Shah Jahan spent the last years of his life, imprisoned by his son
Aurangzeb. His private quarters where he was confined, has a magical view of the Taj
Mahal across the river Yamuna.
<br>
<br>
Overnight at Hotel.
<br><br>

<b>Day 05: Agra – Jaipur</b><br>

Post breakfast drive to Jaipur enroute visit fatehpur sikri a UNESCO World Heritage
site. A deserted red sandstone city that was built during the second half of the 16th
century by the Emperor Akbar, Fatehpur Sikri (the City of Victory) was the capital of
the Mughal Empire for only some 10 years. The complex of monuments and temples, all in a
uniform architectural style, includes one of the largest mosques in India, the Jama
Masjid.
<br><br>
After visit continue drive to Jaipur.
<br><br>
Jaipur: The origins of the beautiful city of Jaipur can be traced back to the eighteenth
century, during the reign of Jai Singh II who ascended the Amber throne in 1699. Jaipur
today epitomizes the spirit of Rajputana. Inspite of growing into bustling metropolis,
it still retains it’s character and history.... a beautiful fusion of yesteryears and
modernity. For long called the Pink city because of the extensive use of the locally
abundant pink plastered stone, painted so in honour of the visit of the royal consort of
Queen Victoria. Jaipur thrills the soul with its massive forts, magnificent palaces,
exquisite temples and lush gardens.
<br><br>
Upon arrival check in at Hotel.
<br><br>
Overnight at Hotel. <br><br>
<br>

<b>Day 06: In Jaipur </b><br>

After breakfast you will visit Amber Fort. Hill forts were always important to the
Rajput rulers. Belonging to the Hindu “Kshatriya” or warrior class, they believed in the
line from the sacred holy book, the Purana that “a fort is the strength of a king”. They
built a number of such forts all over the state of Rajasthan; some made for purely
defensive purposes, but most built as fort palaces. Amber is one of the finest examples
of a fort palace, built similar in style to the surrounding richly decorated Mughal
courts.
<br><br>
This afternoon you will proceed on a city tour of Jaipur. You will tour part of the City
Palace which is open to the public. The most striking building on entering through the
Atish Pol or stable gate is the beautiful marble and sandstone Mubarak Palace, initially
used to welcome foreign dignitaries and later used as the Cabinet Office. Today the
palace houses the textile gallery exhibiting an excellent collection of costumes and
rich textiles from the private collection of the Jaipur royal family. The armory is
entered through the magnificent marble inlaid Singh Pol or Lion Gate. The most
impressive part of the place is the Diwan-I-Khas or the hall of Private audience.
Entered through a gateway richly decorated in pietra dura and flanked by a pair of
elephants carved out of a single block of marble, the star exhibits of this area are a
pair of enormous sterling silver vessels used to store holy water from the Ganges. The
water was used by the Maharaja for his daily bath when traveling overseas, to protect
him from ritual pollution. Also of interest is the Art Gallery which has a collection or
royal memorabilia. The Jantar Mantar which you visit next is a collection of futuristic
structures and astronomical instruments designed by Sawai Jai Singh the founder of
Jaipur. This was a result of this intense study of Astrology and Astronomy, and these
17th century extraordinary structures are accurate even today.
<br><br>
Overnight at Hotel

<br><br>


<b>Day 07: Jaipur – Varanasi </b><br>

Moring in time transfer to airport to connect flight for Varanasi via Delhi.
<br><br>
Arrive in Varanasi. Meet & greet by a dnata representative at the airport who will later
escort you to your hotel, where you stay for 02 nights.
<br><br>
Varanasi is probably the place in India that has the most profound impact on visitors.
Formerly known as Benares, it sits on a bend of the Ganges, and its spiritual
significance comes from its status as a "crossing place", where Gods and Goddesses can
descend to earth. It has been a pilgrimage site since the sixth century BC; Hindus try
to visit at least once in their lifetime to pray and bathe in the holy river. The Old
City, a maze of tiny alleys, has several temples, including the Golden Temple - which is
only accessible to Hindus - and many cows, which have traffic priority. <br>
<br><br>
Overnight at Hotel.<br>

<b>Day 08: In Varanasi </b><br>

Early morning, enjoy a boat cruise on River Ganges. The ghats - hundreds of stone steps
flanking the riverbank - are an incredible sight, particularly at sunrise when thousands
of pilgrims bathe in the spiritually cleansing waters. Funeral pyres smoke on the
riverbank, which is lined with colorful temples. The boat ride is one of the best ways
witness the ceremonies.
<br><br>
Also referred to as "city of temples and learning", the culture of Varanasi is deeply
associated with the river Ganges and the river's religious importance. The city has been
a cultural and religious center in northern India for thousands of years. Walk through
the narrow streets and alleys of Varanasi. Wandering through this maze will be
fascinating; a great opportunity for photos.
<br><br>
After the boat ride, return to hotel for breakfast.
<br><br>
In the morning visit the famous Banaras Hindu University. One of the oldest educational
centres of India, this university was was founded by Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya in 1917
for the study of Sanskrit, Indian art, culture and music. The university campus extends
over five square kms and contains the Bharat Kala Bhavan.
<br><br>
Continue to New Vishwanath Temple which is Located within the premises of the Banaras
Hindu University.
<br><br>
Also visit Bharat Mata Mandir. Opened by Mahatma Gandhi, this temple is dedicated to
'Mother India. This simple temple has a perfect relief map of India carved out of a
Marble.
<br><br>
The tour culminates at Durga Temple. This 18th century Durga Temple is also called the
Monkey Temple. It has been built in a common north Indian style with an ornate shikhara,
with five segments symbolizing the elements, supported by finely carved columns.
<br><br>
Afternoon visit Sarnath. It is one of the important Buddhist centres where Lord Buddha
had preached his first sermon and set in motion the Wheel of Law
(Maha-Dharmachakra-Pravartan). Several Buddhist structures were raised at Sarnath
between 3rd century BC and 11th century AD. Most of the ancient buildings and structures
at Sarnath were damaged or destroyed by the Turks. However, amongst the ruins The Dhamek
Stupa is the most distinguished one. It was built in 500 AD to replace an earlier
structure commissioned by the great Mauryan king Ashoka in 249 B.C.E., along with
several other monuments, to commemorate his pilgrimage there. Also visit the museum
which houses a collection of valuable ancient scriptures & artifacts related to
Buddhism(Sarnath museum is closed on Friday).
<br><br>
Evening witness a Hindu prayer ceremony `aarthi' on the Ganges River! You will be
escorted to Dhaswashmedh Ghat on bi-cycle rickshaw from where you will embark on a boat
to witness the aarti for approximately 20- 30 minutes. En-route, drive past through the
local bazaars. The river banks `ghats' and temples are lit with oil-lamp and candles
which create a magical effect. Devotees float the oil lamps in the water as an offering
to the holy river.
<br><br>
Overnight at Hotel.
<br><br>
    <b>Day 09: Varanasi – Chandigarh via Delhi & drive to Shimla</b><br>

    Morning transfer to airport to connect flight for Chandigarh via Delhi. Upon arrival

    96 kilometers and more than two-thirds of the entire track on curves, some as sharp as
    48 degrees. It is also distinguished as one of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The toy
    train chugs along the line, whistling through the deodar, pine, ficus, oak and maple
    woods at a speed of 22 kilometers an hour. As the journey begins, one is taken in with
    the change in vegetation, and the majestic glory of the railway stations and
    Gothic-style bridges en route. After an exciting short toy train ride, you shall

Situated on the northwestern border of the country, Amritsar means the “Pool of Nectar”, the name derived from a pool constructed at a sacred site gifted by Akbar to Guru Ramdas in the 6th century.  This 400-year-old city has been the center of Sikh religion and culture since the time of its inception and is famous for the Golden Temple.<br>
<br><br>
Life in Amritsar is deeply influenced by the holy shrines of the Golden Temple and the Durgiana Temple, plus the sources of the city’s wealth-agriculture, commerce and industry.  Even though most people are very religious, they are also extremely fun loving and full of life.  They have earned their money by sheer hard work, and they spend it lavishly on the good things of life.<br>
